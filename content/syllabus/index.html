<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This is a graduate-level course in cancer bioinformatics. This course aims to introduce the core principles of Cancer Bioinformatics, Computational Genomics, and Biostatistics.</p>
<p>Genomics and the use of next-generation sequencing are at the forefront of biomedical research. Sequencing market is constantly evolving, stimulating the development of new analytical approaches and software tools. To effectively analyze and interpret genomic sequencing data, it is crucial to (1) understand the technologies that produce the data and (2) develop strong computational skills that will be flexible in this dynamic environment.</p>
<p>This is a blended course that combines in-class learning (lectures, labs) with self-directed activities. The course will introduce high-throughput genomic assays including DNA sequencing and genome variation analysis, transcriptome profiling with RNA-seq and miRNA-seq, metagenomics, epigenomic analysis including ChIP-seq and methylation assays, single-cell sequencing, and chromatin conformation capture technologies.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Homework will consist of problem sets for the material covered. Files should be named, e.g., <code>HW01_LASTNAME.Rmd</code>. The homework due date is one week after the lecture. Late homework will NOT be accepted unless permission was given by the instructor. Assignments that are not well organized/documented will receive no credit. Working in small groups is allowed. However, you must do the final writing-up of solutions entirely by yourself. Any two assignments that are word-for-word exactly the same or highly similar in the coding style will receive zero credit. There will be no extra credit projects available.</p>

### Late Policy

Students get 1 free assignment to submit late without penalties. Please email us through Sakai that you need more time. If you need accommodation, please email us so we can figure out a way to help you.

Graduate Studies in the VCU School of Medicine is committed to providing grades to students in a timely manner. Course instructors will provide students with information in writing at the beginning of each course that describes the grading policies and procedures, including but not limited to evaluation criteria, expected time needed to grade individual student examinations and type of feedback they will provide.

Class grades are due to the Registrar by the Friday following the week of finals. However, on those occasions when a grade has not been submitted by the deadline, the following procedure shall be followed:

1)  The Department/Program Coordinator will immediately contact the Instructor requesting the missing grade, with a copy to the Program Director and Registrar.

2)  If the grade is still overdue by the end of next week, the Department/Program Coordinator will email the Department Chair directly, with a copy to the Instructor and Program Director requesting resolution of the missing grade.

3)  If, after an additional week, the grade is still outstanding, the student or Department/Program Coordinator may petition the Office of Graduate students for final resolution.

1.  *For courses that are run by a specific department.*

2.  *For the conjoined courses (course number is preceded by CON\_ that
    are run by Graduate Studies.*
