Red Blood Cell trivia [Source](http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(16)30141-0)

One in four cells in the human body is a mature enucleated red blood cell (RBC), also called an erythrocyte. RBC mean lifespan in adults is 100–120 days, requiring constant renewal. To that end, we produce on average 2.4 million RBCs per second in the bone marrow. This massive yet well-orchestrated cell proliferation process is necessary to accommodate RBCs’ main function: to transport oxygen from the lungs to the peripheral organs, and carbon dioxide from the organs to the lungs.
