# Gene annotations

## Gene identifiers

**Gene**

- **Ensembl:** ENSG00000139618
- **Entrez Gene:** 675
- **Unigene:** Hs.34012

**RNA transcript**

- **GenBank:** BC026160.1
- **RefSeq:** NM_000059
- **Ensembl:** ENST00000380152

---
## ID cross-mapping

- There are many IDs

- Software tools recognize only a handful

- Humans better recognize gene names

---
## ID challenges

- Avoid errors: map IDs correctly
    - Beware of 1-to-many mappings

- Gene name ambiguity â€“ not a good ID
    - e.g. BMFS5, LFS1, TRP53, p53
    - Better to use the standard gene symbol, not aliases: TP53

- Excel error-introduction
    - OCT4 is changed to October-4  (open file/paste as text)

- Problems reaching 100% cross-mapping
    - E.g. due to version issues
    - Use multiple sources to increase coverage

---
## Reference Sequences (RefSeq)

- Reference standard
    - Eukaryotes: genomic, transcript, protein sequences, derived from: 
        - Computation
        - Manual curation of submitted data
        - Collaboration with other experts

- 69,000 organisms
    - >7000 viruses, >40,000 prokaryotes, >10,000 eukaryotes

## HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) Gene Names

This resource lists gene name synonyms, which is useful if you are conducting a comprehensive literature search and need to find articles about a gene that may have been called other names in the past.

## ID conversion helpers

- `clusterProfiler::bitr()` function - Biological Id TranslatoR

- `HGNChelper` R package to correct invalid Human/Mouse Gene Symbols

- `annotables` R package by Stephen Turner, annotating/converting Gene IDs

- `AnnotationDbi` R package for manipulation of SQLite-based annotations

- `biomaRt` R package - Interface to BioMart databases (i.e. Ensembl)

## BiomaRt basics

Biomart R package, `biomaRt`, workflow:

- Discover and select an organism-specific mart and dataset
- Select filters, which IDs to convert from
- Select attributes, which IDs to convert to
- Run the query

- For genomic coordinates, use database that corresponds to genome assembly version you are interested in 

- Biomart has a web interface, operating on the same principles

---
## BiomaRt

The `getBM()` function has three arguments that need to be introduced: **filters**, **attributes** and **values**. 

- **Filters** define a restriction on the query. Tell BiomaRt what kind of IDs do you have, so it will look for it. The `listFilters()` function shows you all available filters in the selected dataset

- **Attributes** define the values we are interested in to retrieve. Which IDs associated with your IDs you want to get. The `listAttributes()` function displays all available attributes in the selected dataset

- **Values** is a vector of IDs you want to convert

# Annotation packages

---
## Annotation packages

- _Bioconductor_ provides extensive access to 'annotation' resources, see the "AnnotationData" biocViews hierarchy.

- `AnnotationDBI` - is a cornerstone of "AnnotationData" packages, provides user interface and database connection code for annotation data packages using SQLite data storage.

.small[ http://bioconductor.org/packages/AnnotationDbi

https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData ]

---
## Annotation packages

- **org** packages (e.g., `org.Hs.eg.db`) contain maps between different gene identifiers, e.g., ENTREZ and SYMBOL. The basic interface to these packages is described on the help page `?select`

- **TxDb** packages (e.g., `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene`) contain gene models (exon coordinates, exon / transcript relationships, etc) derived from common sources such as the hg38 `knownGene` track of the UCSC genome browser. These packages can be queried, e.g., as described on the `?exonsBy` page to retrieve all exons grouped by gene or transcript.

https://bioconductor.org/packages/TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene ]

---
## Annotation packages

- **EnsDb** packages and databases (e.g. `EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86`) provide, similar to TxDb packages, gene models, but also protein annotations (protein sequences and protein domains within these) and additional annotation columns such as `"gene_biotype"` or `"tx_biotype"` defining the *biotype* of the features (e.g. lincRNA, protein_coding, miRNA etc). `EnsDb` databases are designed for Ensembl annotations and contain annotations for all genes (protein coding and non-coding) for a specific Ensembl release.

- **BSgenome** packages (e.g., `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19`) contain whole genomes of model organisms. See `available.genomes()` for pre-packaged genomes.

## Annotation methods

- Annotation packages usually contain an object named after the package itself.  These objects are collectively called `AnnotationDb` objects with more specific classes named `OrgDb`, `ChipDb` or `TranscriptDb` objects.  

- Methods that can be applied to these objects include `cols()`, `keys()`, `keytypes()` and `select()`.
