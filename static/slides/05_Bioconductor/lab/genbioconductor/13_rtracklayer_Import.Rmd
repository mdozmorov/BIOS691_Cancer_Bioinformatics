## Dependencies

This document has the following dependencies:

```{r dependencies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rtracklayer)
library(AnnotationHub)
library(Rsamtools)
```

Use the following commands to install these packages in R.

```{r biocLite, eval=FALSE}
source("http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("rtracklayer", "AnnotationHub", "Rsamtools"))
```

## Overview

The `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` package interfaces to (UCSC) Genome Browser.  It contains functions for importing and exporting data to this browser.

This includes functionality for parsing file formats associated the UCSC Genome Browser such as BED, Wig, BigBed and BigWig.

## The import function

The function to parse data formats is `import()`.  This function has a `format` argument taking values such as `BED` or `BigWig`.

Note that there is a help page for the general `import()` function, but there are also file format specific help pages.  The easiest way to get to these help pages is to look for `XXFile` with `XX` being the format.

```{r help, eval=FALSE}
?import
?BigWigFile
```

There are often format specific arguments.

## BED files

Most BED files are small and can be read as a single object.  The output of `import(format = "BED")` is a `GRanges`.

You can specify `genome` (for example `hg19`) and the function will try to make an effort to populated the `seqinfo` of the `GRanges`.

You can also use the `which` argument to selectively parse a subset of the file which overlaps a `GRanges`.  This becomes much more efficient if the file has been tabix-indexed (see below).

## BigWig files

BigWig files typically store whole-genome coverage vectors (or at least whole-genome data).  For this reason, the R representation of a BigWig file is usually quite big, so it might be necessary to read it into R in small chunks.

As for BED files, `import(format="BigWig")` supports a `which` argument which is a `GRanges`.  It output data type is a `GRanges` per default, but using the `as` agurment you can have `as="Rle"` and a few other options.

The `import(format="BigWig")` does not support a `genome` argument.

## Other file formats

- GFF
- TwoBit
- Wig
- bedGRaph

## Extensive example

Let us start an `AnnotationHub`:

```{r ahub}
library(AnnotationHub)
ahub <- AnnotationHub()
table(ahub$rdataclass)
```

At this point, you should have seen several of these file formats mentioned.  The `GRanges` are usually directly constructed from BED file, and the `seqinfo` information is fully populated:
```{r granges}
ahub.gr <- subset(ahub, rdataclass == "GRanges" & species == "Homo sapiens")
gr <- ahub.gr[[1]]
gr
seqinfo(gr)
```

Perhaps more interesting is the data in form of BigWig files.
```{r BigWig}
ahub.bw <- subset(ahub, rdataclass == "BigWigFile" & species == "Homo sapiens")
ahub.bw
bw <- ahub.bw[[1]]
bw
```
This returns us a file name, ready for use by `import`.
```{r importBigWig}
gr1 <- gr[1:3]
out.gr <- import(bw, which = gr1)
out.gr
```
This gives us the content in the form of a `GRanges`.  Often, an `Rle` might be appropriate:
```{r importBigWig2}
out.rle <- import(bw, which = gr1, as = "Rle")
out.rle
```
You can get all of `chr22` by
```{r importBigWig3}
gr.chr22 <- GRanges(seqnames = "chr22",
                    ranges = IRanges(start = 1, end = seqlengths(gr)["chr22"]))
out.chr22 <- import(bw, which = gr.chr22, as = "Rle")
out.chr22[["chr22"]]
```


## LiftOver

LiftOver is a popular tool from the UCSC Genome Browser for converting between different genome versions.  The `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` package also exposes this function through the `liftOver`.  To use `liftOver` you need a so-called "chain" file describing how to convert from one genome to another.  This can be obtained by hand from UCSC, or directly from `r Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")`.

We can re-use our `AnnotationHub`:

```{r liftOver}
ahub.chain <- subset(ahub, rdataclass == "ChainFile" & species == "Homo sapiens")
query(ahub.chain, c("hg18", "hg19"))
chain <- ahub.chain[ahub.chain$title == "hg19ToHg18.over.chain.gz"]
chain <- chain[[1]]
gr.hg18 <- liftOver(gr, chain)
gr.hg18
```
This converts a `GRanges` into a `GRangesList`, why?  This is because a single range (interval) may be split into multiple intervals in the other genome.  So each element in the output correspond to a single range in the input.  If the ranges are small, most ranges should be mapped to a single range.  Let us look at the number of elements in output:
```{r liftOver2}
table(elementLengths(gr.hg18))
```
Only a few ranges were not mapped and only a few were split.

## Importing directly from UCSC

Using `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` you can import tables and tracks directly from the UCSC Genome Browser.  However, it is now possible to get a lot (all?) of this data from `r Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")` and this later package seems friendlier.

It is possible that not all tracks / tables and/or all information from the different track / tables from UCSC are exposed in `r Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")`.

See a detailed exposition in the package vignette.

## Tabix indexing

Tabix indexing is a way to index a text file with chromosomal positions for random access.  This will greatly speed up any querying of such a file.  The [tabix](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) functionality was introduced in the SAMtools library; this library was later renamed to htslib.

Tabix indexing is usually something you do at the command line, but there is also the convenient possibility of doing it from inside Bioconductor using `indexTabix` from the `r Biocpkg("Rsamtools")` package.  First however, the file needs to be bgzip2 compressed, which you can do using the `bgzip2` function.  A full pipeline, using an example SAM file from `r Biocpkg("Rsamtools")` is
```{r tabixIndex}
library(Rsamtools)
from <- system.file("extdata", "ex1.sam", package="Rsamtools",
                    mustWork=TRUE)
from
to <- tempfile()
zipped <- bgzip(from, to)
idx <- indexTabix(zipped, "sam")
```
see also the help page for `indexTabix`.
