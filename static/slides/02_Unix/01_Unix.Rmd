## What is Unix

- Unix is a family of operating systems and environments that exploits the power of linguistic abstractions to perform tasks
- Unix is not an acronym; it is a pun on "Multics". Multics was a large multi-user operating system that was being developed at Bell Labs shortly before Unix was created in the early '70s. Brian Kernighan is credited with the name
- All computational genomics is done in Unix

## History of Unix

- Initial file system, command interpreter (shell), and process management started by Ken Thompson
- File system and further development from Dennis Ritchie, as well as Doug McIlroy and Joe Ossanna
- Vast array of simple, dependable tools that each do one simple task

## Philosophy of Unix

- Vast array of simple, dependable tools

- Each do one simple task, and do it really well

- By combining these tools, one can conduct rather sophisticated analyses

- The Linux help philosophy: "RTFM" (Read the Fine Manual)

---
## Know your Unix

- Unix users spend a lot of time at the **command line**

- In Unix, a word is worth a thousand mouse clicks

---
## Unix systems

- Three common types of laptop/desktop operating systems: Windows, Mac, Linux.
- Mac and Linux are both Unix-like!
- What that means for us: Unix-like operating systems are equipped with "shells"" that provide a command line user interface.

---
## Shell, aka command line, aka terminal

- Shell is an interactive environment with a set of commands to initiate and direct computations

- Shell encloses the complexity of OS, hence the name  
    - You type in commands 
    - Shell executes them

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell 

---
## Shell, aka command line, aka terminal

- The Bourne shell (`sh`) is a shell, or command-line interpreter, for computer operating systems

- Developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs, 1976

- `bash` (the Bourne-Again shell) was later developed for the GNU project and incorporates features from the Bourne shell, `csh`, and `ksh`. It is meant to be POSIX-compliant

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne 

---
## Most popular types of shell

- `bash` - Bourne-Again shell

- `tcsh` - TENEX C shell

- `zsh` - Z shell

- Change shell: `chsh –s /bin/zsh`

- `$SHELL` environmental variable has path to the currently used shell

---
## Getting to the command line

- Remote access, SSH, **PuTTY** (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), **MobaXterm** (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)

- **Mac OS X + Xcode development suite** (free, https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) + **X11 server** (free, https://www.xquartz.org/) + **iTerm2** (optional, https://iterm2.com/)

- **Ubuntu Linux** (long-term support LTS version, XX.04, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

---
## Getting to the command line | Windows users   

- **Cygwin**, http://www.cygwin.com/

- **Git Bash**, https://git-for-windows.github.io/ 

- Boot from a CD or USB (search for "linux usb")

- Install the whole Linux systems as a Virtual Machine in **VirtualBox**, https://www.virtualbox.org/

---
## Getting to the command line | Mac users  

- "Terminal" is already installed, `bash` shell

- Why? Darwin, the system on which Apple's Mac OS X is built, is a derivative of 4.4 BSD-Lite2 and FreeBSD. In other words, the Mac is a Unix system

- For X11 (graphics), see XQuartz, http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/

- `iTerm2` - a better terminal replacement for Mac, https://www.iterm2.com/

---
## Obtaining new command-line software

- Modern Unix systems have package managers to that download install (free) software for you

- On a Mac, **Homebrew** (http://brew.sh/) is a popular package-management system (alternatively, **MacPorts**, https://www.macports.org/)

- On Ubuntu, **apt** (https://itsfoss.com/apt-get-linux-guide/) is the standard package manager, with both a command-line and graphical interface available

- On Windows, **Cygwin** (https://cygwin.com/install.html) installs everything precompiled through its setup file. Do not delete `setup-x86_64.exe` file after installing Cygwin, explore what Linux tools are available (a lot)

---
## Interacting with shell

- Most commands take additional arguments that fine tune their behavior

- If you don't know what a command does, use the command `man <command>`

- Press `q` to quit the `man` page viewer

- Most often, you’ll use `<command> -h` or `<command> --help`

- Some commands output help if executed without any arguments

---
## File system: Full vs. relative paths

<center><img src="img/file_paths.png" height="330px" /></center>

- `cd /` - go to the root directory
- `cd /usr/home/jack/bin` - go to the user’s sub-directory
- `cd ..` - go to the upper level directory
- `cd`, or `cd ~` - go to the user’s home directory
- `cd --` - go to the last visited directory

---
## Orienting in the filesystem

- `pwd` 		- print working directory

- `ls` 			- list all files in the current directory

- `ls -1` 	- list files in _one_ column

- `ls –lah`	- list files in `l`ong, `h`uman readable format, include `a`ll content, user, owner, permissions

---
## Creating, moving, copying, and removing files

- `touch <file>` - creates an empty file

- `nano <file>` - edit it

- `mkdir <dirname>` - creates a directory

- `cp <source_file> <target_file>` - copy a file to another location/file

- `mv <source_file> <target_file>` - move a file

- `rm <file>` - remove a file. If multiple files provided, removes all of them

- `rm –r <dirname>` - recursive removal (deletes a directory)

---
## Permissions: `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`

In Unix, every file and directory has an **owner** and a **group**  

- `Owner` - is the one who created a file/directory
- `Group` - defines rules of file operations and/or permissions
- `Every` - user on a Unix machine can belong to one or more groups

Every file has **three permission levels**   

- what the **u**ser can do
- what the **g**roup can do
- what the **a**ll can do

---
## Understanding ls -lah output

- The first column tells you about permissions
    - The very first character in the permissions column tells you what kind of file it is. A **-** means it's a regular file. A **d** means it's a directory
    - The next nine characters come in three classes, each has three characters. The three classes are `owner`/`group`/`world` permissions
    - Inside a permission class, **r** means that class can **r**ead the file; **w** means that class can **w**rite the file; **x** means that class can e**x**ecute the file

- The second column has the number of files (inside a directory)
- The third and fourth columns tell you the owner and group

---
## Finding your files

- `find` - lists all files under the working directory (and its subdirectories) based on arbitrary criteria

- `find .` - prints the name of every file or directory, recursively. Starts from the current directory

- `find . –type f` - finds files only

- `find . –type d –maxdepth 1` - finds directories only, at most 1 level down

- `find . –type f –name "*.mp3"` - finds only *.mp3 files

- `find . -type f -name "README.md" -exec wc -l {} \;` - find files and execute a command on them

---
## Wildcards and patterns

- `*` - matches any character

- `?` - matches a single character

- `[chars]` - matches any character in chars

- `[a-zA-Z]` - matches any character between `a` and `z`, including capital letters

- `ls *.md`

- `ls [Rt]*`

---
## Looking inside files

- `cat <file>` - prints out content of a file. If multiple files, consequently prints out all of them (concatenates)

- `zcat` - prints out content of gzipped files

- `less <file>` - shows the content of the file one screen at a time

**Keyboard shortcuts for more command**  

- `space` - forward, `b` - backward
- `g` - go to the beginning, `G` - go to the end
- `/<text>` - starts forward search, enter to find next instance
- `q` - quit

---
## Chaining commands: pipes

- One of the most useful capabilities of Unix is the ability to redirect the STDOUT of one command into the STDIN of another

- The `|` (pipe) character feeds output from the first program (to the left of the `|`) as input to the second program on the right. Therefore, you can string all sorts of commands together using the pipe

```
find . | wc -l
cat names.txt | sort | uniq -c
```

- Executing one command AFTER another completed successfully: `<command> && <command>`

```
mkdir music && mv *.mp3 music/
```

---
## Chaining commands: redirections

- Nearly every command in Unix makes use of a convention to have a "standard input" (also called stdin or STDIN, or channel 0) and "standard output" (also called stdout or STDOUT, or channel 1)

- There is also a "standard error" (stderr or STDERR, or channel 2) output that is, by convention, reserved for error messages

- `find / 2> error.log` - capture STDERR into a file
- `find / 2> /dev/null` - suppress STDERR messages
- `find / 2>&1` - add STDERR to STDOUT

---
## Chaining commands: redirections

- If you want to dump the standard output into a file, use `command > file` (overwrites the file). `command >> file` (appends to the file)

- Redirection example: `ls > README.md` - save file list in the current directory into README.md file

- Redirection works in another direction: `grep CC0 < License.md`

- Or, the content of a commant into another command: `join <(sort file1) <(sort file2)`

---
## Other essential commands {.smaller}

|           |          |
|-----------|----------|
| head/tail | cut      |
| for       | comm     |
| sort      | echo     |
| uniq      | basename |
| wc        | dirname  |
| tr        | history  |
| grep      | which    |
| join      | who      |
| kill      | grep     |
| tar       | seq      |
| gzip      | paste    |

---
## Shell conveniences

- Tab completion

- `Ctrl-c` - cancel the command you are writing

- `Ctrl-r` - reverse search through your command line history

- `history` - shows your previous commands

- `!<history number>` - repeats specific command. Or, `!ls` to match the most recent `ls` command

- `!!` - repeats the last command

---
## Processes and job control

- As we interact with Linux, we create numbered instances of running programs called “processes.” You can use the `ps` command to see a listing of your processes (and others!).  To see a long listing, for example, of all processes on the system try: `ps -ef` 

- To see all the processes owned by you and other members of the class, try: `ps –ef | grep bash`

- To see the biggest consumers of CPU, use the top command (which refreshes every few seconds): `top`

---
## Foreground/background

- Thus far, we have run commands at the prompt and waited for them to complete.  We call this running in the “foreground.”  It is also possible, using the `&` operator, to run programs in the “background”, with the result that the shell prompts immediately without waiting for the command to complete:

```
$ mycommand &
[1] 54356    <-------- process id
$
```

---
## Backgrounding a running job with C-z and ‘bg’

Sometimes you start a program, then decide you want to run it in the background.  Here’s how:

```
top
```

- Press `C-z` to suspend the job. You can continue working in the terminal, but the job won't be lost

- Type `bg` at the command prompt to see what jobs are available

- To bring the background job back to the foreground, type `fg` at the command prompt

---
## Process control

- To end the job, use the ‘kill’ command, either with the five-digit process id: `kill 56894  #for example!`

- Use `kill -9 PID` to immediately stop the job
